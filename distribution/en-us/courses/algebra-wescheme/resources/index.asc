== Research

*As a member of the Bootstrap Community, we invite you and your class to join our research effort!* +
You'll help us investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum, which helps us improve our existing materials and pedagogy for both students and teachers. +
{empty} +
*In exchange for participation, you'll receive a choice of a $50 Amazon gift card or up to 50 FREE student workbooks.* +
We are in particular need of data from control classes that have not used Bootstrap. If you are able to gather data in a similar class to your Bootstrap class, we can offer an *additional $50 gift card or set of 50 workbooks*. +
{empty} +
*Participation is easy: link:pass:[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTUZrMfDuZmfiacCFo_PJ1vfZ9nNIVjFrcc4uJ4Jqj7l4Mhw/viewform?usp=sf_link][Just fill out this Google Form, window="_blank"] and you'll receive everything you need.  We handle all the grading!* +

You can also help us evaluate how students react to having built a game by having them fill out link:pass:[https://docs.google.com/a/bootstrapworld.org/forms/d/1OcZKapL-JQxuqywaveL29D15ArgGQp3q0f4bKqFD6cQ/edit?ts=57e181f5][this brief (10 minute) anonymous survey, window="_blank"]. +
We frequently get questions about various aspects of the game project, such as creativity and appeal to students.  Your input helps us assess and answer these questions.  (No compensation for the online survey, but you're awesome in our book!)
