[.glossary]
Boolean:: a type of data with two values: true and false
circle of evaluation:: a diagram of the structure of an expression (arithmetic or code)
conditional:: a code expression made of questions and answers
contract:: a statement of the name, domain, and range of a function
coordinate:: a number or set of numbers describing an object's location
datatypes:: a way of classifying values, such as: Number, String, Image, Boolean, or any user-defined data structure
debug:: to find and fix errors in one's code
define:: to associate a descriptive name with a value
definitions area:: the left-most text box in the Editor where definitions for values and functions are written
design recipe:: a sequence of steps that helps people document, test, and write functions
domain:: the type or set of inputs that a function expects
editor:: software in which you can write and evaluate code
error message:: information from the computer about errors in code
example:: shows the use of a function on specific inputs and the computation the function should perform on those inputs
expression:: a computation written in the rules of some language (such as arithmetic, code, or a Circle of Evaluation)
function:: a mathematical object that consumes inputs and produces an output
horizontal axis:: axis on a coordinate plane that runs from left to right
Image:: a type of data for pictures
interactions area:: the right-most text box in the Editor, where expressions are entered to evaluate
Number:: a data type representing a real number
piecewise function:: a function that computes different expressions based on its input
pixel:: the smallest unit that makes up a digital image. The more pixels, the more detailed an image or video can appear.
purpose statement:: a brief description of what a function does
range:: the type or set of outputs that a function produces
String:: a data type for any sequence of characters between quotation marks (examples: "hello", "42", "this is a string!")
syntax:: the set of rules that defines a language, whether it be spoken, written, or programmed.
value:: a specific piece of data, like 5 or "hello"
variable:: a letter, symbol, or term that stands in for a value or expression
vertical axis:: number line on a coordinate plane that runs from bottom to top, indicating values in that direction
