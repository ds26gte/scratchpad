= Defining Values - Practice


1) On the line below, *write the Code* to define `PRIZE-STAR` as the pink outline of a star of size 65.

@span{.blankline}

Using the `PRIZE-STAR` definition from above, draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the Code for each of the exercises. One Circle of Evaluation has been done for you.


[cols="^1a,^1a", stripes="none"]

@span{.clear}{}the size of the original (using `scale`)

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@show{(sexp->coe '(scale 3 PRIZE-STAR))}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}

|3) The outline of a pink star that is half the 
@span{.clear}{}size of the original (using `scale`)

@vspace{1ex}

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{38ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}

|4)  The outline of a pink star of size 65 
@span{.clear}{}that has been rotated 45 degrees

@vspace{1ex}

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{40ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}

|5) The outline of a pink star that is 3 times the size of the original
 *and* has been rotated 45 degrees

@vspace{1ex}

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{40ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}
