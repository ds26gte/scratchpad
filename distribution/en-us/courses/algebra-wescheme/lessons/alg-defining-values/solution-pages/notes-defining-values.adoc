= Defining Values and Functions


- We can define values in our program, giving them names that we can refer to later instead of re-typing the same thing over and over. This works the same way it does in math: @math{x = 5 + 1} defines the symbol @math{x} to be the number @math{6}. 

- In our language, we can define value by writing @show{(sexp->code `(define x (+ 5 1)))}. Here are a few value definitions:
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
----
(define x (+ 5 1))
(define y (* x 7))
(define food "Pizza!")
(define dot (circle y "solid" "red"))
----	
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
----
x = 5 + 1
y = x * 7
food = "Pizza!"
dot = circle(y, "solid", "red")
----	
}

- We can also define new  *functions* in our language, to make it do things it didn't do before! To do this, we use a step-by-step process called the *Design Recipe*.

** The first step is to write the  *Contract* for the function you want to build. Remember, a Contract must include the Name, Domain and Range for the function!

** Then we write a *Purpose Statement*, which is a short note that tells us what the function _should do_. Professional programmers work hard to write good purpose statements, so that other people can understand the code they wrote!

** The second step is to write at least two  *Examples*. These are lines of code that show what the function should do for a _specific_ input. Once we see examples of at least two inputs, we can _find a pattern_ and see which parts are changing and which parts aren't.

** Circle the parts that are changing, and label them with a short *variable name* that explains what they do.

** Finally, the third step is to define the function itself! This is pretty easy after you have some examples to work from: we copy everything that didn't change, and replace the changeable stuff with the variable name!
