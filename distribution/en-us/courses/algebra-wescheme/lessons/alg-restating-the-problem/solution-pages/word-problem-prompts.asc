|7) Write a function `split-tab` that takes in a cost and the number of people sharing the bill and splits the cost equally.

%CURRICULUMtt% class="racket"%BEGINCURRICULUMtt%(define (split-tab cost people) (/ cost people))%ENDCURRICULUMtt%

|8) Write a function `num-cube` that takes in a number and returns the cube of that number.

%CURRICULUMtt% class="racket"%BEGINCURRICULUMtt%(define (num-cube n) (* (* n n) n))%ENDCURRICULUMtt%

|9) Write a function `circle-area` that takes in a radius and returns the area of the circle.

%CURRICULUMtt% class="racket"%BEGINCURRICULUMtt%(define (circle-area radius) (* 3.14 (sqr radius)))%ENDCURRICULUMtt%

|10) Write a function `tip-calculator` that takes in the cost of a meal and returns the 15% tip of that meal.

%CURRICULUMtt% class="racket"%BEGINCURRICULUMtt%(define (tip-calculator cost) (* 0.15 cost))%ENDCURRICULUMtt%

|11) Write a function `minimum-wage`, that takes in a number of hours worked and returns the amount a worker will get paid at $10.25/hr.

%CURRICULUMtt% class="racket"%BEGINCURRICULUMtt%(define (minimum-wage hours) (* 10.25 hours))%ENDCURRICULUMtt%
