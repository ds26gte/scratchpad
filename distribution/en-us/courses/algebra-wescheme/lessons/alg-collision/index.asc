| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Explain how the distance formula is related to the Pythagorean theorem.
* Write a function for the distance formula.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain how the distance formula is connected to the Pythagorean theorem.
* I can write a function that takes in 2 points and returns the distance between them.

* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The distance formula is an excellent review of %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Circles of Evaluation%ENDCURRICULUMspan%. Have students work out the expression in small groups to foster discussion.

[.lesson-section-1]
== Warmup

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
 link:pass:[https://www.wescheme.org][WeScheme, window="_blank"] 
on their computer.

[.lesson-section-1]
== Problem Decomposition Returns! %CURRICULUMspan% class="duration"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%20 minutes%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Overview
Students revisit the problem decomposition concept from link:pass:[../alg-problem-decomposition][earlier, window="_blank"] link:pass:[../alg-compound-inequalities][lessons, window="_blank"].

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Launch
Problem Decomposition is a powerful tool, which lets us break apart complex problems into simpler ones that we can solve, test, and then glue together into a complex solution. 

Students may remember that there are two strategies for doing this:

. *Top-Down:* Describe the problem at a high level, then fill in the details later
. *Bottom-Up:* Focus on the smaller parts that you're sure of, then build them together to get the big picture

Problem Decomposition is the focus of link:pass:[../alg-problem-decomposition][an entire Bootstrap lesson, window="_blank"], is used to solve link:pass:[../alg-compound-inequalities][`onscreen?`, window="_blank"], and build up the 2-dimensional link:pass:[../alg-distance-formula/][distance function, window="_blank"].

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Investigate
For the following complex word problem, have students *first* decide which strategy they want to use, and then apply the Design Recipe to build the functions they need.

[.lesson-instruction]
A retractable flag pole starts out 24 inches tall, and can grow at a rate of 0.6in/sec. An elastic is tied to the top of the pole and anchored 200 inches from the base, forming a right triangle. Define functions that compute the height of the pole and the area of the triangle after a given number of seconds.

Have students complete the link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/alg-collision/pages/top-down-bottom-up.html][Top Down / Bottom Up (Page 57), window="_blank"] worksheet, using Problem Decomposition and the Design Recipe to solve this problem!

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Synthesize
- Which strategy did students use?
- Did they start out with one, and then switch to another?

[.lesson-section-1]
== Collision Detection %CURRICULUMspan% class="duration"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%20 minutes%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Overview
Students once again see function composition at work, as they compose a simple inequality with the `distance` function they've created.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Launch
Knowing how far apart our characters are is the first step. We still need the computer to be asking: "True or False: is there a collision?"

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Investigate
Using
 link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/alg-collision/pages/collide.html][Word Problem: collide? (Page 58), window="_blank"], 
have students write a function that takes in two coordinate pairs (four numbers) of two characters (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and returns a %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Boolean%ENDCURRICULUMspan% as to whether or not the two characters have gotten within 50 %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%pixels%ENDCURRICULUMspan% of each other.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Synthesize
- Since students started out with the `distance` function first, which strategy are they using to decompose collision detection?
- Explicitly point out that this function is easy to write because we can _re-use_ the distance function. 
- Connect this back to `profit`, `revenue`, `cost` and `onscreen` from link:pass:[../alg-problem-decomposition][previous lessons, window="_blank"]. Problem Decomposition is powerful!

[.lesson-section-1]
== Additional Exercises:
- For characters that are much taller than they are wide (or wider than they are tall!), using the radius to determine collision won't work very well. Have students compute the link:pass:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry][Manhattan Distance, window="_blank"] to take the more-rectangular dimensions of their characters.
