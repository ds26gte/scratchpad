By now you know how to make stars in this programming language. Can you figure out how to make triangles, based on what you know about making stars? Rectangles? What other shapes might we be able to make? When you've discovered code to make a new shape, draw the Circle of Evaluation in the table below, along with a sketch of the shape. Then add the function to your contracts page.

1) Use the space below to draw the Circles of Evaluation for the new functions, and draw a picture of what the function produces.

[cols="^.^24,^.^8,^.^8", options="header", stripes="none"]

|Circle of Evaluation 							|				 | Image

|@vspace{10ex}									| produces &rarr;|
|@vspace{10ex}									| produces &rarr;|

4) There is a function called `text`. Try to figure out how to use it! What do the inputs mean?
