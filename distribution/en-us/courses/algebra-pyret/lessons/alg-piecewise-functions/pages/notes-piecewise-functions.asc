- Sometimes we want to build functions that act differently for different inputs. For example, suppose a business charges $10/pizza, but only $5 for orders of six or more. How could we write a function that computes the total price based on the number of pizzas?

- In math, *Piecewise Functions* are functions that can behave one way for part of their Domain, and another way for a different part. In our pizza example, our function would act like %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%costpizzas = 10 * pizzas%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle cost(pizzas) = 10 * pizzas%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan% for anywhere from 1-5 pizzas. But after 5, it acts like %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%costpizzas = 5 * pizzas%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle cost(pizzas) = 5 * pizzas%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.

- Piecewise functions are divided into "pieces". Each piece is divided into two parts: 

. How the function should behave 
. The domain where it behaves that way

- Our programming language can be used to write piecewise functions, too! Just as in math, each piece has two parts:



----
fun cost(pizzas):
  ask:
    | pizzas < 6 then: 10 * pizzas
    | pizzas >= 6 then: 5 * pizzas
  end
end
----


- Piecewise functions are powerful, and let us solve more complex problems. We can use piecewise functions in a video game to add or subtract from a character's x-coordinate, moving it left or right depending on which key was pressed.
