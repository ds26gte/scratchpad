= Composing Image Functions

You’ll be investigating these functions with your partner:

```
# text :: String, Number, String -> Image
# scale :: Number, Image -> Image
# rotate :: Number, Image -> Image
# flip-horizontal :: Image -> Image
# flip-vertical :: Image -> Image
```

1) Make an image of your name, in big purple letters. Draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the code that will create this image.

@vspace{3ex}

@show{(sexp->coe '(text "Eric" 24 "purple"))}

@vspace{3ex}

@show{(sexp->code '(text "Eric" 24 "purple"))}

@vspace{3ex}

2) Try using the `scale` function to make your name bigger or smaller. Draw the Circle of Evaluation (hint: use what you wrote above!), then write the code.

@vspace{3ex}

@show{(sexp->coe '(scale 0.5 (text "Sophie" 24 "purple")))}

@vspace{3ex}

@show{(sexp->code '(scale 0.5 (text "Sophie" 24 "purple")))}

@vspace{3ex}

3) In your own words, what does scale do?

@span{.blankline}{_When the number is less than 1, it scales the image down to a smaller version_}
@span{.blankline}{_When the number is greater than 1, it scales the image up to a larger version_}

@vspace{20ex}

4) Try out `rotate`, `flip-horizontal`, and `flip-vertical`. Use the space below to write your
code, then test out your code in WeScheme when you’re ready.
