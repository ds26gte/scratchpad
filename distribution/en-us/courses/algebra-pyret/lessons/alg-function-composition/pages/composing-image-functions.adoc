= Composing Image Functions

You’ll be investigating these functions with your partner:

```
# text :: String, Number, String -> Image
# scale :: Number, Image -> Image
# rotate :: Number, Image -> Image
# flip-horizontal :: Image -> Image
# flip-vertical :: Image -> Image
```

1) Make an image of your name, in big purple letters. Draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the Code that will create this image.

@vspace{20ex}

2) Try using the `scale` function to make your name bigger or smaller. Draw the Circle of Evaluation (hint: use what you wrote above!), then write the Code.

@vspace{20ex}

3) In your own words, what does `scale` do?

@span{.blankline}{}
@span{.blankline}{}

@vspace{20ex}

4) Try out `rotate`, `flip-horizontal`, and `flip-vertical`. Use the space below to write your Code, then test out your Code in Pyret when you’re ready.
