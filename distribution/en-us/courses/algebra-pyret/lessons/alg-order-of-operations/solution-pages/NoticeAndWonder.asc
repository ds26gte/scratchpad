Try typing numbers into the Interactions Area, hitting "Enter", and see what you get back! Some ideas:

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

. What is the largest number you can enter? The smallest?
. Can you write decimals? Fractions?
. After you get back a decimal, try clicking on it. What happens?
. Can you write negative numbers? Negative fractions?
. What else can you try?

_(sample response) I notice that..._

-_fractions are turned into decimals_

-_if you click on a decimal, you get the fraction back_

-_decimals are written with a zero before the decimal point_

-_repeating decimals are barred rather than rounded_

-_I got tired of making my numbers bigger before the computer did_

-_negative numbers work_
