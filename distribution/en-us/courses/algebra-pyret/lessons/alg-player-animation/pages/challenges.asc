For each of the challenges below, see if you can come up with two EXAMPLEs of how it should work!

1) *Warping* - Program one key to "warp" the player to a set location, such as the center of the screen.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

```
examples:
  update-player(                 ) is  

  update-player(                 ) is     
end                        
```

2) *Boundaries* - Change `update-player` such that `PLAYER` cannot move off the top or bottom of the screen. 

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

```
examples:
  update-player(                 ) is  

  update-player(                 ) is     
end                        
```

3) *Wrapping* - Add code to `update-player` such that when `PLAYER` moves to the top of the screen, it reappears at the bottom, and vice versa.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

```
examples:
  update-player(                 ) is  

  update-player(                 ) is     
end                        
```

4) *Hiding* - Add a key that will make `PLAYER` seem to disappear, and reappear when the same key is pressed again.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

```
examples:
  update-player(                 ) is  

  update-player(                 ) is     
end                        
```
