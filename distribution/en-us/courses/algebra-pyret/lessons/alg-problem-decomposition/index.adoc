| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* There are several ways to write the `profit` function - use this opportunity for discussion and to promote higher-order critical thinking.
* If students are struggling with understanding the basics of the problem, start by coming up with examples of `cost` and `revenue`.  If Sally sells one glass, what is her total revenue?  How much does it cost her to produce that one glass?
* Ensure students understand the difference between "revenue" and "profit", and that "cost" refers to the cost of _making_ the lemonade, not the amount Sally is charging.

== Warmup

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }
and have their workbooks with a pen or pencil.

== Problem Decomposition @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are introduced to word problems that can be broken down into _multiple_ problems, the solutions to which can be composed to solve other problems. They adapt the Design Recipe to handle this situation.

=== Launch
Display the following image:

@span{.title}{Notice and Wonder}

What do you notice?  What do you wonder?
|===

One example of a _relationship_ we can find in this situation is that Sally takes in $1.75 for every glass she sells: @math{revenue = $1.75 \times glasses}

[.lesson-instruction]
What other relationships can you find here?

(Give students a chance to discuss and brainstorm)

- Every glass sold brings in $1.75 in *revenue*
- Every glass sold costs $0.30 in *costs*, such as lemonds, sugar and water
- Every glass sold brings in some amount of *profit*: it costs a certain amount to make, but it brings in another amount in revenue

=== Investigate

Students form groups and brainstorm their ideas for functions.  Students can use any strategies they've learned so far.

MLR 7 - Compare and Connect
There are several correct ways to write the functions needed for Sally's Lemonade.  Have students compare methods and develop understanding and language related to mathematical representation and methods.  What are the advantages of the different solutions?  What are some drawbacks?
|===

- *What is the difference between _revenue_ and _profit_?*
_Revenue is the total amount of money that comes in, profit is the remaining money after cost has been subtracted._

- *How could Sally _increase_ her profits?*
_By decreasing her costs, raising her prices (which increases revenue), by selling more lemonade._

- *What is the _relationship_ between profit, cost, and revenue?*
_Profit = Revenue - Cost_

[.lesson-instruction]
Students work with their partners to develop their function models for
@workbook-link{pages/revenue.adoc, revenue}, @workbook-link{pages/cost.adoc, cost}, and @workbook-link{pages/profit.adoc, profit}, using the Design Recipe.

While students are working, walk the room and gauge student understanding.  There is more than one correct way to write the `profit` function!  Encourage discussion between students and push students to develop their thinking on the advantages and disadvantages of each correct solution.

=== Synthesis
This activity started with a situation, and students modeled that situation with functions. One part of the model was _profit_, which can be written several ways, for example:
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
```
(define (profit g) (- (* 1.75 g) (* 0.30 g)))
(define (profit g) (* (- 1.75 0.30) g))
(define (profit g) (* 1.45 g))
(define (profit g) (- (revenue g) (cost g)))
```
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
```
fun profit(g): (1.75 * g) - (0.30 * g) end
fun profit(g): (1.75 - 0.30) * g end
fun profit(g): 1.45 * g end
fun profit(g): revenue(g) - cost(g) end
```
}

- Which way is "best", and why?
- If lemons gets more expensive, which way requires the least amount of change?
- If sugar gets less expensive, which way requires the least amount of change?

*Big Ideas*

. `profit` can be _decomposed_ into a simple function that uses the `cost` and `revenue` functions.
. Decomposing a problem allows us to solve it in smaller pieces, which are also easier to test!
. These pieces can also be re-used, resulting in writing less code, and less _duplicate_ code.
. Duplicate code means more places to make mistakes, especially when that code needs to be changed.

== Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore problem decomposition as an explicit strategy, and learn about two ways of decomposing.

=== Launch
[.lesson-point]
_Top-Down_ and _Bottom-Up_ design are two different strategies for problem decomposition.

When thinking Bottom-Up, we start with the small, easier relationships first and then build our way to the larger relationships. In the Lemond Stand example, we had you write the lower-level functions - `cost` and `revenue` - _first_, and then gave you the chance to use them in the higher-level `profit` function. This is called *Bottom-Up* design. 

When thinking Top-Down, we start with the "big picture" and then worry about the details later. For example, we could have _started_ with `profit`, and kept track of all the lower-level functions we would need to write. This is called *Top-Down* design.


=== Investigate
Consider the following situation:

__Jamal's trip to Thailand requires him to drive 20 miles to the airport, take a plane 9,000 miles to Thailand, and then a bus 6 miles to his hotel. The average speed when driving to the airport is 40mph, the average speed of an airplane is 575mph, and the average speed of his shuttle bus is 15mph__

*Setting aside time spent waiting at the airport or for the bus, how long is Jamal in transit?*

This problem can be decomposed in Top-Down or Bottom-Up fashion. Describe what your steps would be in each solution (for extra credit, you can actually compute the answer!).

=== Synthesize
Make sure that students see _both_ strategies, and have them discuss which they prefer and why.
