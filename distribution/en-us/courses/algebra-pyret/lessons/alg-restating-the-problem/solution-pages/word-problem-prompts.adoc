|1) Write a function `globo-gym` that takes in a number of months and produces the cost for attending the gym that many months when there is a $150 initiation fee and a monthly fee of $45/month.


@show{(sexp->code `(define (globo-gym months) (+ (* 45 months) 150))) }


|2) Write a function `rect-perimeter` that takes in the length and width of a rectangle and returns the perimeter of that rectangle.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (rect-perimeter l w) (* 2 (+ l w)))) }

|3) Write a function `lawn-area` that takes in a length and width of a lawn and returns the area of that rectangular lawn.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (lawn-area length width) (* length width)))}

|4) Write a function `rectprism-vol` that takes in the length, width, and height of a rectangular prism and returns the Volume of a rectangular prism.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (rectprism-vol l w h)  (* (* l w) h)))}

|5) Write a function `rideshare`, that takes in a number of miles and produces the cost of a ride for that many miles at $2.50 plus $1.50/mile.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (rideshare miles) (+ (* 1.50 miles) 2.50)))}

|6) Write a function `marquee` that takes in a message and returns that message in large gold letters.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (marquee message) (text message 100 "gold")))}

|7) Write a function `split-tab` that takes in a cost and the number of people sharing the bill and splits the cost equally.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (split-tab cost people) (/ cost people)))}

|8) Write a function `num-cube` that takes in a number and returns the cube of that number.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (num-cube n) (* (* n n) n)))}

|9) Write a function `circle-area` that takes in a radius and returns the area of the circle.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (circle-area radius) (* 3.14 (sqr radius))))}

|10) Write a function `tip-calculator` that takes in the cost of a meal and returns the 15% tip of that meal.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (tip-calculator cost) (* 0.15 cost)))}

|11) Write a function `minimum-wage`, that takes in a number of hours worked and returns the amount a worker will get paid at $10.25/hr.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (minimum-wage hours) (* 10.25 hours)))}

|12) Write a function `moving` that takes in the days and number of miles driven and returns the cost of renting a truck. The truck is $55 per day and each driven mile is 15Â¢.

@show{(sexp->code `(define (moving days mi) (+ (* 55 days) (* .15 mi))))}
