skewed left:: A distribution is skewed left if there are a few values that are fairly low compared to the bulk of data values. A display of the data will show a longer tail to the left.
skewed right:: A distribution is skewed right if there are a few values that are fairly high compared to the bulk of data values. A display of the data will show a longer tail to the right.
symmetric:: A symmetric distribution has a balanced shape, showing that it's just as likely for the variable to take lower values as higher values.
