[.alignedStandards.standards-CC-Math]
.Common Core Math Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HSS.ID.A.1:: Represent data with plots on the real number line (dot plots, histograms, and box plots).
HSS.ID.A.3:: Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).
HSS.ID.B.6.A:: Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve problems in the context of the data. Use given functions or choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear, quadratic, and exponential models.



[.alignedStandards.standards-CSTA]
.CSTA Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
3A-DA-11:: Create interactive data visualizations using software tools to help others better understand real-world phenomena.
3B-AP-14:: Construct solutions to problems using student-created components, such as procedures, modules and/or objects.



[.alignedStandards.standards-K12CS]
.K-12CS Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
9-12.Data and Analysis.Visualization and Transformation:: Data can be transformed to remove errors, highlight or expose relationships, and/or make it easier for computers to process.



[.alignedStandards.standards-NGSS]
.Next-Gen Science Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HS-SEP4-2:: Apply concepts of statistics and probability (including determining function fits to data, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient for linear fits) to scientific and engineering questions and problems, using digital tools when feasible.



[.alignedStandards.standards-OK]
.Oklahoma Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
OK.L1.AP.PD.05:: Evaluate and refine computational artifacts to make them more user-friendly, efficient and/or accessible.
