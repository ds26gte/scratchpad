= Data Displays and Lookups

Data scientists use data visualizations to gain better insights into their data, and to communicate their findings with others. Making a display requires answering three questions:

. *What data* is being displayed? This could be "a random sample of 2000 people", "every animal from the shelter", or "students' aged 14-17".

. *What variables* are being explored? Are we looking at the  `species` column? The number of  `kilograms` that an animal weighs? Searching for a relationship between a person's `income` and their  `height`?

. *What display* is being used, given the variables being explored? If it's a quantitative variable, we might use a histogram or box plot. If it's categorical, we could use a pie or bar chart. If it's two quantitative variables, we probably want a scatter plot.

When *looking up a data Row* from a Table, programmers use the `row-n` method. This method takes a single number as its input, which tells the computer which Row we want. _Note: Rows are numbered starting at zero!_

For example:
```
animals-table.row-n(0)  # access the 1st data row
animals-table.row-n(16) # access the 17th data row
``` 

When *looking up a column* from a Row, programmers use square brackets and the name of the column they want.

For example:
```
animals-table.row-n(11)["age"]      # look up the age of the animal in the 12st data row
animals-table.row-n(14)["species"]  # look up the species of the animal in the 15th data row
```

Throughout the rest of the workbook, we will sometimes refer to animalA and animalB.  
```
animalA = animals-table.row-n(4)
animalB = animals-table.row-n(13)
```
