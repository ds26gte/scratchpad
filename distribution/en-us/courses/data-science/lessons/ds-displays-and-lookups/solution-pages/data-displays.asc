%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

5) A `scatter-plot`, using the animals' `species` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `pounds` as the y-axis.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

6) A `scatterplot`, using the animals' `name` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis.

[cols="^1,^1,^1",options="header"]
