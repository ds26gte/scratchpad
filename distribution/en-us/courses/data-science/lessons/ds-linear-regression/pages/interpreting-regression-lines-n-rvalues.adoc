|*1*
| For every additional Marvel Universe movie released each year, the average person is predicted to consume @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[amount]} @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[more / fewer]} pounds of sugar! This correlation is @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[strong, moderate, weak, non-existent]}.

| Shoe size and height are @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[strongly, moderately, weakly, not]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[positively / negatively]} correlated. If person A is one size bigger than person B, we predict that they will be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[amount]} inches taller than person B as well.

| There is @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[a strong, a moderate, a weak, no]} relationship found between the number of Uber drivers in a city and the number of babies born each year.

| The correlation between weeks-of-school-missed and SAT score is @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[strong, moderate, weak, non-existent]} and @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[positive / negative]}. For every week a student misses, we predict a more than a @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[amount]} point @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[gain / drop]} in their SAT score.

|*5*
| There is a @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[strong, moderate, weak, non-existent]}, @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[positive / negative]} correlation between the number of streaming video services someone has, and how much they weigh. For each service, we expect them to be roughly @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[amount]} pounds heavier.
