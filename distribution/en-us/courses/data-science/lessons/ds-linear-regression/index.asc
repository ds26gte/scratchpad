== Warmup
Have students open their “Animals Dataset” files. (If they do not have this file, or if something has happened to it, they can always make a link:pass:[https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1gaYAyYhvlKBm6VJuvJDcnoINBw76pL-L][new copy, window="_blank"].)

[.lesson-instruction]
Make two scatterplots from the `animals-table`, using `age` as the explanatory variable in one plot and `pounds` as the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%explanatory variable%ENDCURRICULUMspan% in the other. In both plots, use `weeks` as your %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%response variable%ENDCURRICULUMspan% and `name` for the `labels`. We will refer to the explanatory column as “xs” and the response column as “ys.”

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Overview
Students are introduced to the _concept_ of linear regression, and learn how to interpret the slope and intercept. For teachers who have the need and the bandwidth to go deeper, this is a good opportunity to teach the algorithm behind linear regression.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Launch
[.lesson-point]
“Can we _predict_ an animal's adoption time based on its size? Its age?”

Have students write down what they think on link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/ds-linear-regression/pages/whats-on-your-mind.html][What’s on your mind? (Page 81), window="_blank"], then quickly survey the class.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="right"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="tooltip"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="tooltiptext"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%weeks-v-pounds scatterplot%ENDCURRICULUMspan%
image:{pathwayrootdir}lessons/ds-linear-regression/images/pounds-v-weeks.gif["weeks-v-pounds scatterplot", 300]link:images/pounds-v-weeks.gif[%CURRICULUMspan% class="big"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%&#x1f5bc;%ENDCURRICULUMspan%Show image,role="gdrive-only"]%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%
We are asking if we can use an animal’s size or age to predict how long it will take to be adopted. A scatter plot of adoption time versus size does suggest that smaller animals get adopted in a shorter period of time and larger animals take longer. Similarly, younger animals tend to be adopted faster than older ones. Can we be more precise about this, and actually _predict_ how long it will take an animal to be adopted, based on these factors? And which one would give us a better prediction?

The mean, median, and mode are three different ways to measure the “center” of a dataset in one dimension. Each represents a different way to collapse a bunch of points on a number line into a single, summary value. If the “center” of points on a _one dimensional_ number line is a single point, what is the “center” of points in a _two-dimensional_ cloud, which cluster around a line?

What we need to do is find a _line_ -- called a %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%line of best fit%ENDCURRICULUMspan%, or a %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%regression line%ENDCURRICULUMspan% -- that is at the center of this cloud. Each point in our scatter plot “pulls” on the line, with points above the line yanking it up and points below the line dragging it down. Points that are really far away -- especially influential observations that are far out in the x direction —- pull on the line with more force. This line can be graphed on top of the scatter plot as a function, called the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%predictor function%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.

Given a value on the x-axis, this line allows us to predict what the corresponding value on the y-axis might be. This allows us to make predictions based on our data.

Is there only one “best line”? Based on methods of calculus, data scientists know the answer to this question is yes! That justifies us talking about a single “line of best fit.”

Data scientists use a statistical method called %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%linear regression%ENDCURRICULUMspan% to pinpoint linear relationships in a dataset. When we draw our %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%regression line%ENDCURRICULUMspan% on a scatter plot, we can imagine a rubber bands stretching vertically between the line itself and each point in the plot -- every point pulls the line a little “up” or “down”. Linear regression is the math behind the line of best fit.

== Linear Regression in Pyret %CURRICULUMspan% class="duration"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%20 minutes%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Overview
Students are introduced to the `lr-plot` function in Pyret, which performs a linear regression and plots the result.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Launch
Pyret includes a powerful display, which (1) draws a scatterplot, (2) draws the line of best fit, and (3) even displays the equation for that line:

----
# use linear regression to extract a predictor function
# lr-plot :: (t :: Table, ls :: String, xs :: String, ys :: String) -> Image
lr-plot(animals-table, "name", "age", "weeks")
----

%CURRICULUMspan% class="right"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="centered-image"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%image:{pathwayrootdir}lessons/ds-linear-regression/images/lr-explained.png["", 400]link:images/lr-explained.png[%CURRICULUMspan% class="big"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%&#x1f5bc;%ENDCURRICULUMspan%Show image,role="gdrive-only"]%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%
`lr-plot` is a function that takes a Table and the names of *3 columns*:

- `ls` -- the name of the column to use for _labels_ (e.g. “names of pets”)
- `xs` -- the name of the column to use for _x-coordinates_ (e.g. “age of each pet”)
- `ys` -- the name of the column to use for _y-coordinates_ (e.g. “weeks for each pet to be adopted”)

Our goal is to use values of the variable on our x-axis to _predict_ values of the variable on our y-axis.

[.strategy-box, cols="1", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
%CURRICULUMspan% class="title"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Pedagogical Note%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

We prefer the words “explanatory” and “response” in our curriculum, because in other contexts the words “dependent” and “independent” refer to whether or not the variables are related at all, as opposed to what role each plays in the relationship.
|===

Have students create an `lr-plot` for our `animals-table`, using `"names"` for the labels, `"age"` for the x-axis and `"weeks"` for the y-axis.

The resulting scatterplot looks like those we’ve seen before, but it has a few important additions. First, we can see the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%line of best fit%ENDCURRICULUMspan% drawn onto the plot. We can also see the equation for that line (in red), in the form %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%y = mx + b%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle y = mx + b%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%. In this plot, we can see that the slope of the line is 0.792, which means that on average, each extra year of age results in an extra 0.792 weeks of waiting to be adopted (about 5 or 6 extra days). By plugging in an animal’s age for _x_, we can make a _prediction_ about how many weeks it will take to be adopted. For example, we predict a 5-year-old animal to be adopted in %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%0.7925 + 2.285 = 6.245%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle 0.792(5) + 2.285 = 6.245%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan% weeks. That’s the y-value exactly on the line at x=5.  

The intercept is `2.285`. This is where the best-fitting line crosses the y-axis. We want to be careful not to interpret this too literally, and say that a newborn animal would be adopted in 2.285 weeks, because none of the animals in our data set was that young. Still, the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%regression line%ENDCURRICULUMspan% (or %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%line of best fit%ENDCURRICULUMspan%) suggests that a baby animal, whose age is close to 0, would take only about 3 weeks to be adopted.

We also see the %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%r%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle r%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%-value is +0.442. The sign is positive, consistent with the fact that the scatter plot point cloud, along with the line of best fit, slopes upward. The fact that the magnitude falls well between 0 and 1 tells us that the strength is moderate. This is consistent with the fact that the scatter plot points are somewhere between being really tightly clustered and really loosely scattered.

[.strategy-box, cols="1", grid="none", stripes="none"]

|
%CURRICULUMspan% class="title"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Going Deeper%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

Students may notice another value in the lr-plot, called %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%R^2%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle R^2%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%. This value describes the _percentage of the variation in the y-variable that is explained by least-squares regression on the x variable_. In other words, an %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%R^2%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle R^2%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan% value of 0.20 could mean that “20% of the variation in adoption time is explained by regressing adoption time on the age of the animal”. Discussion of %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%R^2%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle R^2%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan% may be appropriate for older students, or in an AP Statistics class.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Make another lr-plot, but this time use the animals' weight as our explanatory variable instead of their age.
- If an animal is 5 years old, how long would our line of best fit predict they would wait to be adopted? What if they were a newborn, just 0 years old?
- If an animal weighs 21 pounds, how long would our line of best fit predict they would wait to be adopted? What if they weighed 0.1 pounds?
- Make another lr-plot, comparing the `age` v. `weeks` columns for _only the cats_.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Synthesize
A predictor only _makes sense within the range of the data that was used to generate it_. Statistical models are just proxies for the real world, drawn from a limited sample of data: they might make a useful prediction in the range of that data, but once we try to extrapolate beyond that data we may quickly get into trouble!

Does the linear regression for our sample of the Animals Dataset allow us to _make inferences_ about the behavior of the larger dataset? Why or why not?

[.lesson-section-1]
== Interpreting LR Plots in Pyret %CURRICULUMspan% class="duration"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%20 minutes%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Overview
Students learn how to _write_ about the results of a linear regression, using proper statistical terminology and thinking through the many ways this language can be misused.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Launch
How well can you interpret the results of a linear regression analysis? Can you write your own?

[.lesson-instruction]
- What does it mean when a data point is _above_ the line of best fit?
- What does it mean when a data point is _below_ the line of best fit?

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/ds-linear-regression/pages/interpreting-regression-lines-n-rvalues.html][Interpreting Regression Lines & r-Values (Page 78), window="_blank"], and match the write-up on the left with the line of best fit and %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%r%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle r%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%-value on the right.
- Turn to link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/ds-linear-regression/pages/regression-analysis-in-animals-dataset.html][Regression Analysis in the Animals Dataset (Page 79), window="_blank"] to see how Data Scientists would write up the finding involving cats’ age and adoption time. Write up two other findings from the linear regressions you performed on this dataset.

When looking at a regression for adoption time v. age for just the cats, we saw that the slope of the predictor function was +0.23, meaning that for every year older a cat is, we expect a +0.23-week increase in the time taken to adopt the cat. The %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%r%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle r%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%-value was +0.566, confirming that the correlation is positive and indicating moderate strength.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Common Misconceptions
Students often think it doesn’t matter which variable is assigned to be x and which is y in a regression. It’s true that you’ll get the same correlation either way---for example, %CURRICULUMspan% class="gdrive-only"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%r=+0.442%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="begin-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMSCRIPT%%BEGINCURRICULUMSCRIPT%\displaystyle r=+0.442%ENDCURRICULUMSCRIPT%%CURRICULUMspan% class="end-ignore-for-gdrive"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan% whether your scatter plot shows `weeks` v. `pounds` or `pounds` v. `weeks`. *However, the regression line _is_ different, due to the math involved in minimizing _vertical_ distances from the line, not horizontal*.

You’ve learned how linear regression can be used to fit a line to a linear cloud, and how to determine the direction and strength of that relationship. The word “linear” is important here. In the image on the right, there’s clearly a pattern, but it doesn’t look like a straight line! There are many other kinds of statistical models out there, but all of them work the same way: use a particular kind of mathematical function (linear or otherwise), to figure out how to get the “best fit” for a cloud of data.
