8.SP.A.1:: Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement data to investigate patterns of association between two quantities. Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative association, linear association, and nonlinear association.
8.SP.A.2:: Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that suggest a linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess the model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line.
8.SP.A.3:: Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept. 
HSS.ID.B.6.C:: Fit a linear function for a scatter plot that suggests a linear association.
HSS.ID.C.7:: Interpret the slope (rate of change) and the intercept (constant term) of a linear model in the context of the data.
HSS.ID.C.8:: Compute (using technology) and interpret the correlation coefficient of a linear fit.
HSS.ID.C.9:: Distinguish between correlation and causation.

3A-DA-11:: Create interactive data visualizations using software tools to help others better understand real-world phenomena.
3B-NI-05:: Use data analysis tools and techniques to identify patterns in data representing complex systems

9-12.Data and Analysis.Inference and Models:: The accuracy of predictions or inferences depends upon the limitations of the computer model and the data the model is built upon. The amount, quality, and diversity of data and the features chosen can affect the quality of a model and ability to understand a system. Predictions or inferences are tested to validate models.



[.alignedStandards.standards-NGSS]
.Next-Gen Science Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HS-SEP3-5:: Make directional hypotheses that specify what happens to a dependent variable when an independent variable is manipulated.



[.alignedStandards.standards-OK]
.Oklahoma Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
OK.L1.DA.IM.01:: Show the relationships between collected data elements using computational models.
OK.PA.D.1.3:: Collect, display and interpret data using scatterplots. Use the shape of the scatterplot to informally estimate a line of best fit, make statements about average rate of change, and make predictions about values not in the original data set. Use appropriate titles, labels and units.
