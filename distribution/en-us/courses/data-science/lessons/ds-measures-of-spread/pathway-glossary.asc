box plot:: the box plot (a.k.a. box-and whisker-plot) is a way of displaying a distribution of data based on the five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum
interquartile range:: (IQR) is one possible measure of spread, based on dividing a data set into four parts. The values that divide each part are called the first quartile (Q1), the median, and third quartile (Q3). IQR is calculated as Q3 minus Q1.
median:: the middle element of a quantitative data set
quartiles:: three values that divide a data set into four equal-sized groups
range of a data set:: the distance between minimum and maximum values
shape:: The aspect of a dataset that tells which values are more or less common
spread:: the extent to which values in a data set vary, either from one another or from the center
