<h3 id="_overview">Overview</h3>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Students are introduced to the notion of <em>spread</em> in a dataset. They learn about quartiles, box plots, and how to use them to talk about spread.</p>
</span>
</span>
<span class="sect2 lesson-section-2">
<h3 id="_launch">Launch</h3>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>A teacher may report that her students averaged a 75 on a test, but it’s important to know how those scores were spread out: did all of them get exactly 75, or did half score 100 and the other half 50? When Data Scientists use the mean of a sample to estimate the mean of a whole population, it’s important to know the spread in order to report how good or bad a job that estimate does.</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose we lined up all of the values in the pounds column of the animals data set from smallest to largest, and then split the line up into two equal groups by taking the <span class="vocab">median</span>. We can learn something about the <span class="vocab">spread</span> of the data set by taking things further: The middle of the lighter half of animals is called the first <span class="vocab">quartile</span> - or "Q1" - and the middle of the heavier half of animals is the third quartile (also called "Q3"). Once we find these numbers, we can say that the middle half of the animals’ weights are spread between Q1 and Q3.</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph lesson-instruction">
<p>The first quartile (Q1) is the value for which 25% of the animals weighed that amount or less. What does the third quartile represent?</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Besides looking at the median as center, and the spread between Q1 and Q3, we also gain valuable information from the spread of the entire data set—that is, the distance between minimum and maximum. This is called the <span class="vocab">range of a data set</span>.</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>We can use <span class="vocab">box plots</span> to visualize all of this information. These plots are constructed using <strong>just five numbers</strong>, which makes them convenient ways to display both center and spread of a data set in a clear and simple way. Below is the contract for <code><span class="pyret">box-plot</tt></code>, along with an example that will make a box plot for the <code><tt class="pyret">pounds</tt></code> column in the <code><tt class="pyret">animals-table</span></code>.</p>

<span class="paragraph">
<p>This plot shows us the center and spread in our dataset according to those five numbers.</p>
</span>
<span class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>minimum</strong> value in the dataset (at the left of “whisker”). In our dataset, that’s just 0.1 pounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>First Quartile (Q1)</strong> (the left edge of the box), is computed by taking <em>the median of the lower half of the values</em>. In the pounds column, that’s 4.3 pounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Median</strong> value (the line in the middle), which is the middle Quartile of the whole dataset. We already computed this to be 13.4 pounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Third Quartile (Q3)</strong> (the right edge of the box), which is computed by taking <em>the median of the upper half of the values</em>. That’s 68 pounds in our dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>maximum</strong> value in the dataset (at the right of the “whisker”). In our dataset, that’s 172 pounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>One way to summarize the spread in the dataset is to measure the distance between the largest value and the smallest value. When we talk about functions having many possible outputs, we use the term “Range” to describe them. (<strong>Note</strong>: the term “Range” means something different in statistics than it does in algebra and programming!) When we look at the distance between the smallest and largest values in our dataset, we use the same term.</p>

<p>Just as pie and bar charts are ways of visualizing categorical data, box plots and histograms are both ways of visualizing the shape of quantitative data. Box plots make it easy to see the 5-number summary, and compare the Range and Interquartile Range. Histograms make it easier to see skewness and more details of the shape, and offer more granularity when using smaller bins.</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Left-skewness is seen as a long tail in a histogram. In a box plot, it&#8217;s seen as a longer left "whisker" or more spread in the left part of the box. Likewise, right skewness is shown as a longer right "whisker" or more spread in the right part of the box.</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Box plots and Histograms can both tell us a lot about the shape of a dataset, but they do so by grouping data quite differently. A box plot is always divided into four parts, which may fall on differently-sized intervals but all contain the same number of points. A histogram, on the other hand, has identically-sized intervals which can contain very different numbers of points.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge Questions:</strong>
- Compare the  for the <code><span class="pyret">pounds</span></code> column of both cats and dogs in the dataset. Are their shapes different? How much overlap is there?
- Compare histograms for the <code><span class="pyret">age</span></code> column of both cats and dogs in the dataset. Are their shapes different? How much overlap is there?
- Can you explain why the amount of overlap between these two distributions is different?</p>

<p>Mutiple box plots are extremely useful for showing us the answer to a particular kind of <strong>Relate Question</strong>, such as "Do dogs take longer to get adopted than cats?" This is really asking us about the interplay between a categorical variable (species) and a quantitative one (weeks to adoption). Instead of creating a whole new display tool, all we have to do is extend our usual box plot display so we can look at how the weeks distributions compare for cats and dogs. This works fine as long as we’re sure to use a common scale: Note that both box plots in the display below share the same axis for adoption times, which ranges from about 1 to 10 weeks.</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Box plots make it easy to decide if values of a quantitative variable seem to be fairly similar or quite different, depending on which group an individual is in. The trick is to train your eyes to look for whether there’s a lot of overlap in the two box plots, or if one is noticeably higher than the other.</p>

<p>Box plots and histograms give us two different views on the concept of shape. In a histogram, the intervals between the bars are fixed with different numbers of datapoints in each interval. A box plot is the exact opposite: the intervals are variable, with a fixed number of datapoints in each one. In a histogram, we can think of a datapoints that fall into bins, filling them up so we can see how many are in each. A box plot treats the data more like pizza dough, dividing it into four equal quarters and squeezing or stretching it to show where the data is tightly clumped or spread out over a long interval.

<p>Referring to our first side-by-side box plots, the one for dogs’ adoption times was much higher than the one for cats’ adoption times; the top half of the dogs’ box plot doesn&#8217;t overlap at all with the cats’ box plot. Does this suggest that species <em>does</em> or <em>does not</em> play a role in how long it takes for an animal to be adopted?</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Referring to our second pair of box plots, we saw that adoption times for unfixed and fixed animals overlapped a lot, and the medians (shown by the lines through the middle of each box) were pretty close: both a bit less than 4. Does this suggest that being fixed or not does or does not play a role in how long it takes for an animal to be adopted?</p>
</span>
<span class="paragraph">
<p>Which variable seems to have more of an effect on adoption time: species (cat or dog) or whether an animal is fixed or not? Have students share back their findings.</p>
