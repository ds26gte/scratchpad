Consider the following dataset, representing the annual income of ten people. 

All numbers represent __thousands of dollars__ (so `14` means "$14,000"):

  60, 10, 21, 180, 14, 20, 45, 35, 45, 170

1) In the space below, rewrite this dataset in  *sorted order*.

__10, 14, 20, 21, 35, 45, 45, 60, 170, 180__

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 1ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

2) In the table below, compute the  *measures of center* for this dataset.

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options='header']
|===
| Mean (Average) | Median 	| Mode(s)
| 60			 | 40   	| 45
|===

3) In the table below, compute the  *five number summary* of this dataset.

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options='header']
|===

| Minimum | Q1	| Q2 (Median) | Q3 	| Maximum

| 10	  | 20  | 40 	  	  | 60  | 180
|===

4) On the number line below, draw a  *box plot* for this dataset.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="centered-image"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%image:{pathwayrootdir}lessons/ds-measures-of-spread/solution-pages/boxplot.png["", 800]link:boxplot.png[%CURRICULUMspan% class="big"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%&#x1f5bc;%ENDCURRICULUMspan%Show image,role="gdrive-only"]%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

5) The following statements are _correct_ ... but misleading. Write down the reason why.

[cols="2a,5a"]

|===
| Statement | Why it’s misleading

| “They’re rich! The average person makes $60k dollars!” 
| The mean is easily manipulated by a few outliers. For a dataset with this skew, median would have been a better measure.

| “It’s a middle-income list: the most common salary is $45k/yr!” 
| This is true, but mode should rarely be used for quantitative data with as much variability as this. The fact that $45k appears _twice_ doesn't tell us enough information about the shape for this claim to be valid.

| “This group is really diverse, with people making as little as 10k and as much as $280k!”
| Two data points - especially the extremes! - should not be used to make a claim about shape.
