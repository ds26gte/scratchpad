Consider the following dataset, representing the annual income of ten people. 

All numbers represent __thousands of dollars__ (so `14` means "$14,000"):

  60, 10, 21, 180, 14, 20, 45, 35, 45, 170

1) In the space below, rewrite this dataset in  *sorted order*.

2) In the table below, compute the  *measures of center* for this dataset.
