= Numbers and Strings

Make sure you’ve loaded the code.pyret.org editor, and clicked “Run”.

. Try typing `42` into the Interactions Area and hitting “Enter”. What happens?

. Try typing in other Numbers. What happens if you try a decimal like `0.5`? A fraction like `1/3`? Try really big Numbers, and really small ones.

. String values are always in quotes. Try typing your name (in quotes!). What happens when you hit Enter?

. Try typing your name with the opening quote, but _without_ the closing quote. What happens? Now try typing it without any quotes.

. Is _42_ the same as `"42"`? Why or why not? Write your answer below:

== Operators

[start=6]
. Just like math, Pyret has *operators* like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. Try typing in `4 + 2`, and then `4+2` (without the spaces). What can you conclude from this? Write your answer below:
+
@span{.blankline}{(sample answer) Pyret needs spaces around operators}
@span{.blankline}{}

. Type in the following expressions, one at a time: `4 + 2 + 6`, `4 + 2 * 6`, `4 + (2 * 6)`. What do you notice? Write your answer below:
+
@span{.blankline}{(sample answer) If we use multiple operators, we need parentheses}
@span{.blankline}{}

. Try typing in `4 + "cat"`, and then `"dog" + "cat"`. What can you conclude from this? Write your answer below: +
+
@span{.blankline}{(sample answer) We can use + to add two numbers or two strings, but not a number and a string}
@span{.blankline}{}
