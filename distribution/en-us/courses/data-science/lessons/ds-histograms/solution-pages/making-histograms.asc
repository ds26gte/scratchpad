Suppose we have a data set for number of teeth in a group of 50 adults: 

[cols="^3a,^2a",options="header"]
|===
| Number of teeth 	| Count
|  0 				| 5
| 22 				| 1
| 26 				| 1
| 27 				| 1
| 28 				| 4
| 29 				| 3
| 30 				| 5
| 31 				| 3
| 32 				| 27

|===

*Draw a histogram for the table in the space below.* For each row, find which interval
(or “bin”) on the x-axis represents the right number of teeth. Then fill in the box so that
the height of the box is equal to the _sum of the counts_ that fit into that interval. One of
the intervals has been completed for you.
