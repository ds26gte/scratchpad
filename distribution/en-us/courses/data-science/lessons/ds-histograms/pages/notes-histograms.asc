To best understand histograms, it's helpful to contrast them first with bar charts.


*Bar charts* show the number of rows belonging to a given category. The more rows in each category, the taller the bar.

-  _Bar charts provide a visual representation of the frequency of values in a  *categorical* column._

- There’s no strict numerical way to order these bars, but  *sometimes there’s an order* that makes sense. For example, bars for the sales of different t-shirt sizes might be presented in order of smallest to largest shirt.

*Histograms* show the number of rows that fall within certain intervals, or “bins”, on a horizontal axis. The more rows that fall within a particular “bin”, the taller the bar.

	- _Histograms provide a visual representation of the frequencies (or relative frequencies) of values in a  *quantitative* column._

	- Quantitative data *can always be ordered*, so the bars of a histogram always progress from smallest (on the left) to largest (on the right).

	- When dealing with histograms, it’s important to select a good  *bin size*. If the bins are too small or too large, it is difficult to see the shape of the dataset. Choosing a good bin size can take some trial and error!


The *shape* of a data set tells us which values are more or less common. 

	- In a  *symmetric* data set, values are just as likely to occur a certain distance above the mean as below the mean. 

	- A data set that is *skewed left* and/or has low outliers has a few values that are unusually low. The histogram for a skewed left dataset has a few data points that are stretched out to the left (lower) end of the x-axis. 

	- A data set that is *skewed right* and/or high outliers means there are a few values that are unusually high. The histogram for a skewed right dataset has a few data points that are stretched out to the right (higher) end of the x-axis.

	- One way to visualize the difference between a histogram of data that is *skewed left* or *skewed right* is to think about the lengths of our toes on our left and right feet. Much like a histogram that is "skewed left", our left feet have smaller toes on the left and a bigger toe on the right.  Our right feet have the big toe on the left and smaller toes on the right, more closely resembling the shape of a histogram of "skewed right" data.
