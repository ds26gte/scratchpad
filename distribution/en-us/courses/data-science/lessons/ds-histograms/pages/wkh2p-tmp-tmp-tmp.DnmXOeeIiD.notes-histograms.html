To best understand histograms, it&#8217;s helpful to contrast them first with bar charts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Bar charts</strong> show the number of rows belonging to a given category. The more rows in each category, the taller the bar.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bar charts provide a visual representation of the frequency of values in a  <strong>categorical</strong> column.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s no strict numerical way to order these bars, but  <strong>sometimes there’s an order</strong> that makes sense. For example, bars for the sales of different t-shirt sizes might be presented in order of smallest to largest shirt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Histograms</strong> show the number of rows that fall within certain intervals, or “bins”, on a horizontal axis. The more rows that fall within a particular “bin”, the taller the bar.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Histograms provide a visual representation of the frequencies (or relative frequencies) of values in a  <strong>quantitative</strong> column.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quantitative data <strong>can always be ordered</strong>, so the bars of a histogram always progress from smallest (on the left) to largest (on the right).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When dealing with histograms, it’s important to select a good  <strong>bin size</strong>. If the bins are too small or too large, it is difficult to see the shape of the dataset. Choosing a good bin size can take some trial and error!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>shape</strong> of a data set tells us which values are more or less common.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a  <strong>symmetric</strong> data set, values are just as likely to occur a certain distance above the mean as below the mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A data set that is <strong>skewed left</strong> and/or has low outliers has a few values that are unusually low. The histogram for a skewed left dataset has a few data points that are stretched out to the left (lower) end of the x-axis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A data set that is <strong>skewed right</strong> and/or high outliers means there are a few values that are unusually high. The histogram for a skewed right dataset has a few data points that are stretched out to the right (higher) end of the x-axis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way to visualize the difference between a histogram of data that is <strong>skewed left</strong> or <strong>skewed right</strong> is to think about the lengths of our toes on our left and right feet. Much like a histogram that is "skewed left", our left feet have smaller toes on the left and a bigger toe on the right.  Our right feet have the big toe on the left and smaller toes on the right, more closely resembling the shape of a histogram of "skewed right" data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
