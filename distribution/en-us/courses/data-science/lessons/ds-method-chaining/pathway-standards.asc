[.alignedStandards.standards-CSTA]
.CSTA Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
2-AP-13:: Decompose problems and subproblems into parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs
2-AP-17:: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases
3A-AP-17:: Decompose problems into smaller components through systematic analysis, using constructs such as procedures, modules, and/or objects.
3A-AP-18:: Create artifacts by using procedures within a program, combinations of data and procedures, or independent but interrelated programs.



[.alignedStandards.standards-K12CS]
.K-12CS Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
6-8.Algorithms and Programming.Control:: Programmers select and combine control structures, such as loops, event handlers, and conditionals, to create more complex program behavior.
9-12.Algorithms and Programming.Control:: Programmers consider tradeoffs related to implementation, readability, and program performance when selecting and combining control structures.
9-12.Algorithms and Programming.Modularity:: Complex programs are designed as systems of interacting modules, each with a specific role, coordinating for a common overall purpose. These modules can be procedures within a program; combinations of data and procedures; or independent, but interrelated, programs. Modules allow for better management of complex tasks.
P3:: Recognizing and Defining Computational Problems



[.alignedStandards.standards-NGSS]
.Next-Gen Science Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HS-SEP4-1:: Analyze data using tools, technologies, and/or models (e.g., computational, mathematical) in order to make valid and reliable scientific claims or determine an optimal design solution.



[.alignedStandards.standards-OK]
.Oklahoma Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
OK.L1.AP.M.01:: Break down a solution into procedures using systematic analysis and design.
