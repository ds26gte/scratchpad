[.alignedStandards.standards-CC-Math]
.Common Core Math Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
8.SP.A.1:: Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement data to investigate patterns of association between two quantities. Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative association, linear association, and nonlinear association.
HSF.BF.A.1:: Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.



[.alignedStandards.standards-CSTA]
.CSTA Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
2-AP-14:: Create procedures with parameters to organize code and make it easier to reuse.
2-AP-17:: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases
2-AP-19:: Document programs in order to make them easier to follow, test, and debug.



[.alignedStandards.standards-K12CS]
.K-12CS Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
6-8.Algorithms and Programming.Modularity:: Programs use procedures to organize code, hide implementation details, and make code easier to reuse. Procedures can be repurposed in new programs. Defining parameters for procedures can generalize behavior and increase reusability.
6-8.Algorithms and Programming.Variables:: Programmers create variables to store data values of selected types. A meaningful identifier is assigned to each variable to access and perform operations on the value by name. Variables enable the flexibility to represent different situations, process different sets of data, and produce varying outputs.
9-12.Algorithms and Programming.Modularity:: Complex programs are designed as systems of interacting modules, each with a specific role, coordinating for a common overall purpose. These modules can be procedures within a program; combinations of data and procedures; or independent, but interrelated, programs. Modules allow for better management of complex tasks.
P4:: Developing and Using Abstractions



[.alignedStandards.standards-NGSS]
.Next-Gen Science Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HS-SEP5-3:: Apply techniques of algebra and functions to represent and solve scientific and engineering problems.



[.alignedStandards.standards-OK]
.Oklahoma Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
OK.8.AP.PD.02:: Incorporate existing code, media, and libraries into original programs of increasing complexity and give attribution.
OK.A1.F.1.3:: Write linear functions, using function notation, to model real-world and mathematical situations.
