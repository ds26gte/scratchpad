.Common Core Math Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
8.SP.A.1:: Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement data to investigate patterns of association between two quantities. Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative association, linear association, and nonlinear association.
8.SP.A.2:: Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that suggest a linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess the model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line.
HSS.ID.B.6:: Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
HSS.ID.C.8:: Compute (using technology) and interpret the correlation coefficient of a linear fit.
HSS.ID.C.9:: Distinguish between correlation and causation.

2-DA-09:: Refine computational models based on the data they have generated.
3B-NI-05:: Use data analysis tools and techniques to identify patterns in data representing complex systems
3B-NI-07:: Evaluate the ability of models and simulations to test and support the refinement of hypotheses.

6-8.Data and Analysis.Visualization and Transformation:: Computer models can be used to simulate events, examine theories and inferences, or make predictions with either few or millions of data points. Computer models are abstractions that represent phenomena and use data and algorithms to emphasize key features and relationships within a system. As more data is automatically collected, models can be refined.

[.alignedStandards.standards-NGSS]
.Next-Gen Science Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HS-SEP6-1:: Make a quantitative and/or qualitative claim regarding the relationship between dependent and independent variables.



[.alignedStandards.standards-OK]
.Oklahoma Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
OK.L1.DA.IM.01:: Show the relationships between collected data elements using computational models.
OK.PA.D.1.3:: Collect, display and interpret data using scatterplots. Use the shape of the scatterplot to informally estimate a line of best fit, make statements about average rate of change, and make predictions about values not in the original data set. Use appropriate titles, labels and units.
