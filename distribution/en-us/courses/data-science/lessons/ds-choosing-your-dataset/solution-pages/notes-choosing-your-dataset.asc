When selecting a dataset to explore,  _pick something that matters to you!_  You'll be working with this data for a while, so you don't want to pick something at random just to get it done.

When choosing a dataset, it's a good idea to consider a few factors:

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

. Is it *interesting*? This should be data you are curious about, that answers questions you'd want to ask. Pick a dataset you're genuinely interested in, so that you can explore questions that matter to you!

. Is it *relevant*? Does this data impact you in any way? Are there questions you have about the dataset that mean something to you or someone you know? Pick a dataset that deals with something personally relevant to you!

. Is it *familiar*? You wouldn't be able to make samples of the Animals Dataset properly if you didn't know that some animals are much bigger or longer-lived than others. Pick a dataset you know about, so you can use your expertise to deepen your analysis!
