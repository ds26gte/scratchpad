= Scatter Plots

*Scatter Plots* can be used to show a relationship between two quantitative columns. Each row in the dataset is represented by a point, with one column providing the x-value and the other providing the y-value. The resulting “point cloud” makes it possible to look for a relationship between those two columns.

- If the points in a scatter plot appear to follow a straight line, it is possible that a linear relationship exists between those two columns. A number called a *correlation* can be used to summarize this relationship.

- @math{r} is the name of the  *correlation statistic*. The @math{r}-value will always fall between −1 and +1. The sign tells us whether the correlation is positive or negative.  Distance from 0 tells us the strength of the correlation. 
** −1 or +1 is really strong.
** 0 means no correlation.

- The correlation is *positive* if the point cloud slopes up as it goes farther to the right. It is  *negative* if it slopes down as it goes farther to the right. If the points are tightly clustered around a line, it is a *strong* correlation. If they are loosely scattered, it is a *weak* correlation.

- Points that are far above or below the cloud of points in a scatter plot are called  *outliers*.

- We graphically summarize this relationship by drawing a straight line through the data cloud, so that the vertical distance between the line and each of the points is as small as possible. This line is called the *line of best fit* and allows us to predict y-values based on x-values.
