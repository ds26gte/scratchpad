Consider the following list dataset, representing the heaviest bench press (in
lbs) for ten powerlifters:

----
135, 95, 230, 135, 203, 55, 1075, 135, 110, 185
----

1, In the space below, rewrite this dataset in sorted order.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vskip"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

2, In the table below, compute the measures of center for this dataset.

[cols='3']
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)

3, The following statements are correct ... but misleading. Write down the
reason why.

| Statement | Why it’s misleading

|
“More personal records are set at 135 lbs than any other weight!”
|

|
“The average powerlifter can bench press 235 lbs.”
|

|
“With a median of 135, that means that half the people in this group can’t even lift 135 lbs.”
