mean:: average, calculated as the sum of values divided by the number of values
median:: the middle element of a quantitative data set
mode:: the most commonly appearing categorical or quantitative value or values in a data set
outlier:: a data point that is unusually far above or below most of the others
skew:: lack of balance in a datasetâ€™s shape, arising from more values that are unusually low or high. Such values tend to trail off, rather than be separated by a gap (as with outliers).
