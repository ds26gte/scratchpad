Many important questions (“What’s the best restaurant in town?”, “Is this law good for citizens?”, etc.) are answered with _data_. Data Scientists try and answer these questions by writing _programs that ask questions about data_.


Data of all types can be organized into  *Tables*.

- Every Table has a *header row* and some number of  *data rows*.
- *Quantitative data* is numeric and measures _an amount_, such as a person’s height, a score on a test, distance, etc. A list of quantitative data can be ordered from smallest to largest.
- *Categorical data* is data that specifies _qualities_, such as sex, eye color, country of origin, etc. Categorical data is not subject to the laws of arithmetic -- for example, we cannot take the “average” of a list of colors.

Answering questions with data can take many forms. Here are a few types of questions, each requiring a different kind of analysis:

- *Lookup Questions* can be answered just by finding the right row and column of a table. (e.g., “How old is Toggle?”)
- *Compute Questions* can be answered by computing over a single row or column. (e.g., “What is the average weight of animals from the shelter?”)
- *Relate Questions* require looking for trends across multiple columns. (e.g.,  “Do cats tend to be adopted sooner than dogs?”)
