= “Trust, but verify…”

A “helpful” Data Scientist gives you access to the following functions:

----
# old-dogs-nametags:: (animals :: Table) -> Table
# consumes a table of animals, and produces a table containing only
# dogs 5 years or older, with an extra column showing their name in red
----

You can use the function, _but you can’t see the code for it!_ *How do you know if you
can trust their code?*

1) What qualities would a verification subset need to have?

@span{.blankline}{At least one of each species, to make sure non-dogs are filtered out}

@span{.blankline}{Animals - especially dogs - whose ages are both ≥ and < than 5 }

@span{.blankline}{At least two old dogs with different names}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

2) Create your verification subset! In the space below, list the name and index of
each animal in your subset.
