A “helpful” Data Scientist gives you access to the following functions:

----
# fixed-cats :: (animals :: Table) -> Table
# consumes a table of animals, and produces a table containing only
# cats that have been fixed, sorted from youngest-to-oldest
----

You can use the function, _but you can’t see the code for it!_ *How do you know if you
can trust their code?*

*HINT:*

- You could make a _verification subset_ that contains one of every species, and
make sure that the function filters out everything but cats

- You could make sure this subset has multiple cats not already ordered of youngest-to-oldest, and make sure the function puts them in the right order

1) What other qualities would this subset need to have?

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%It should contain animals - especially cats - that are fixed and unfixed%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

2) Create your verification subset! In the space below, list the name of each animal in
your subset.
