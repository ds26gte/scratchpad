1) Evaluate the `big-animals-table` in the Interactions Area. This is the _complete_ population of animals from the shelter! Below is a true statement about that population:

[.lesson-point]
The population is 47.7% fixed and 52.3% unfixed.

2) How close to these percentages do we get with random samples? 

Type each of the following lines into the Interactions Area and hit â€œEnter".
----
random-rows(big-animals-table, 10)
random-rows(big-animals-table, 40)
----
3) What do you get? %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 92ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

4) What is the contract for `random-rows`? %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 70ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

5) What does the `random-rows` function do?

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

6) In the Definitions Area, define `tiny-sample` and `small-sample` to be these two random samples.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

7) Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing percentages of fixed and unfixed. 

- The percentage of fixed animals in the entire populations is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%*47.7%*%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.
- The percentage of fixed animals in `tiny-sample` is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.
- The percentage of fixed animals in `small-sample` is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

8) Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%*roughly 5%*%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `tiny-sample` is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%
 
9) Click "Run" to direct the computer to generate a different set of random samples of these sizes. Make a new `pie-chart` for each sample, showing percentages for each species.

- The percentage of tarantulas in the entire population is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%*roughly 5%*%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `tiny-sample` is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.
- The percentage of tarantulas in `small-sample` is %CURRICULUMspan% class="fitb" style="width: 20ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%.

%CURRICULUMspan% class="vspace" style="height: 2ex"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

10) Which repeated sample gave us a more accurate inference about the whole population? Why?
