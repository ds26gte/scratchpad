_The animal shelter wanted to find out what kind of food to buy for their animals. They took a random sample of two animals and the food they eat, and they found that spider and rabbit food was by far the most popular cuisine!_

What are some possible threats to the validity of this conclusion?

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Two animals is _not_ large enough to be a representative sample! %ENDCURRICULUMspan%

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%It's too easy to randomly choose animals that give us unreliable conclusions.%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%The sample size is too small to be representative.%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

_A volunteer opens the shelter in the morning and walks all the dogs. At mid-day, another volunteer feeds all the dogs and walks them again. In the evening, a third volunteer walks the dogs a final time and closes the shelter. The volunteers report that the dogs are much friendlier and more active at mid-day, so the shelter staff assume the second volunteer must be better with animals then the others._

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%There may be several confounding variables here. Perhaps the volunteer is carrying bacon in their pocket!%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

%CURRICULUMspan% class="blankline"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Or perhaps dogs are in better moods in the middle of the day, when the sun is out%ENDCURRICULUMspan%
