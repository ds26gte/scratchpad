Data scientists conducted a study of *15,000 people living in Alaska and New Mexico*. They wanted to find out if people in colder climates spent more money on footwear. They discovered that *Alaskans spent an average of $150 per year on shoes, whereas New Mexicans spent an average of $45 per year*.
