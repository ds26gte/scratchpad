== The issue

It seems like “false facts” are on the rise today.  People share conclusions in the media – including social media – that may be a misrepresentation of the data.  Graphic representations of data can often be misleading.  To understand the factors that undermine our confidence in conclusions, some important questions to ask are:

. How was the sample that was surveyed selected?
. How many people were surveyed?
. Did the sample selected cover all represented in the population we want information on?
. What other factors could be at play in the situation that could impact the conclusion made?


[.lesson-section-1]
== Objective

Students will demonstrate understanding of the various types of threats to validity and their impact on conclusions made. 


[.lesson-section-1]
== Procedure

With a partner, decide on a research question from a topic of your choosing.  Check the topic with your teacher.  Create a claim based on faulty sampling techniques which incorporate: 

- Selection bias
- Sample size problems
- Sampling errors
- Confounding variables


[.lesson-section-1]
== Produce

Create a presentation (could be Google Slides, poster, or be creative) that addresses:

. Your research topic & question
. Your faulty plan for selecting individuals for the study
. Be sure to incorporate all four threats listed in the procedure section
. Explain what the problems will be with the validity of your conclusion based on the threats you allowed in your sampling
. Explain how you could change your study to minimize these threats

Have fun – pretend to be terrible data scientists – costumes encouraged!

|						| Got it! 	| Mostly	| Getting There	| Somewhat	| Nope
| *Statistical Question:* Clearly outlines the research topic and statistical question.  The question lends itself to many threats needing to be addressed.
						| 15		| 13		| 11			| 4			| 0
| *Threats:* Developed to clearly be a threat to validity.  Includes a threat from each of the four types listed in assignment. 
						| 35		| 27		| 21 			| 10 		| 0

| *Conclusion:* Explained how the threats to validity cause problems to the conclusion.  Explained what changes should be made to minimize the threats. 
						| 40		| 31		| 24			| 12		| 0
| *Neatness of Product:* Project is neat, organized. Clear that effort was put in.
