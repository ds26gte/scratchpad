| What's Wrong

| 1 
| The average player on a basketball team is 6′1″.
| _“Most of the players are taller than 6′.”_
| Average (mean) is highly sensitive to outliers. Most players could be under 6', with one 6'10" player throwing off the mean.

| 2
| Linear regression found a positive correlation (r=0.18) between people’s height and salary.
| _“Taller people get paid more.”_
| Correlation is not causation, and - more importantly - an R-value of 0.18 is very weak and should not be trusted.

| 3

| _“According to the predictor function indicated here, the value on the x-axis is will predict the value on the y-axis 63.6% of the time.”_
| R-Values tell us how much of the _variability_ in the dataset is explained by the predictor, *not how accurate it is!*


| 4
| @centered-image{fake-news-4.png, "Bar Chart of Pet Ages", 400}
| _“According to this bar chart, Felix makes up a little more than 15% of the total ages of all the animals in the dataset.”_
| Felix is _15 years old_.

| 5
| @centered-image{fake-news-5.png, "", 400}
| _“According to this histogram, most animals weigh between 40 and 60 pounds.”_
| Incorrect. The 40-60 pound bin has more animals than any other bin, but it makes up only a small fraction of the whole.

| 6
| Linear regression found a negative correlation (r= -0.91) between the number of hairs on a person’s head and their likelihood of owning a wig.
| _“Owning wigs causes people to go bald.”_
| Correlation is not causation!
