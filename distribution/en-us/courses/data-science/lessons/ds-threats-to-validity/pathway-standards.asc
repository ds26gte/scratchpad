[.alignedStandards.standards-CC-Math]
.Common Core Math Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HSS.IC.B.6:: Evaluate reports based on data.



[.alignedStandards.standards-CSTA]
.CSTA Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
3B-NI-07:: Evaluate the ability of models and simulations to test and support the refinement of hypotheses.



[.alignedStandards.standards-K12CS]
.K-12CS Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
6-8.Data and Analysis.Collection:: People design algorithms and tools to automate the collection of data by computers. When data collection is automated, data is sampled and converted into a form that a computer can process. For example, data from an analog sensor must be converted into a digital form. The method used to automate data collection is influenced by the availability of tools and the intended use of the data.
9-12.Data and Analysis.Inference and Models:: The accuracy of predictions or inferences depends upon the limitations of the computer model and the data the model is built upon. The amount, quality, and diversity of data and the features chosen can affect the quality of a model and ability to understand a system. Predictions or inferences are tested to validate models.
P1:: Fostering an Inclusive Computing Culture



[.alignedStandards.standards-NGSS]
.Next-Gen Science Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
HS-SEP1-7:: Ask and/or evaluate questions that challenge the premise(s) of an argument, the interpretation of a data set, or the suitability of the design.
HS-SEP4-3:: Consider limitations of data analysis (e.g., measurement error, sample selection) when analyzing and interpreting data.



[.alignedStandards.standards-OK]
.Oklahoma Standards
[.standards-hierarchical-table]
OK.L1.IC.C.02:: Test and refine computational artifacts to reduce bias and equity deficits.
